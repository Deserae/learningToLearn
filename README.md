# How Memory and the Brain Work
  The brain has two modes of learning: Focused and Diffused. Focused is what you traditionally think of as learning. It is deliberate and involves concentration. The second is a relaxed state where your brain creates connections. This would be like shower thoughts or perhaps when you daydream. While this one might not feel as important, both are to learn effectively. In order to invoke both styles, you should incorporate breaks into your study. Two of the most important factors in learning are adequate sleep and exercise. 
  Your brain stores knowledge in chunks. Chunks are pieces of information group together in a meaningful way. Chunks can be made of smaller chunks or have connections to other ones. A good example of chunking would be chords a guitarist learns. These chunks can be combined to form a song. That song chunk could be part of a bigger chunk of performance that may include the chunks required to sing as well as play. Storing grouped information makes it easier for our brain to access later without getting bogged down in all the small pieces.

# How to learn
  Now that we know how our brain learns, we can figure out the best techniques to learn efficiently. It’s important to have set time for focused learning where you are actively participating in the process. Come up with analogies and metaphors for abstract ideas. Imagine putting yourself into the activity you are doing and all the associated senses and emotions you would experience. Rereading notes is nowhere near as effective as trying to recall what you have learned or testing yourself. Practice is extremely important as well - you can’t just read and watch - you need to practice that instrument or math equations. Working with others can also help you discover blind spots in your learning. They can also hold you accountable. Being able to summarize and recognize key ideas will help create the bigger picture. 
  These techniques will help you use your learning time more efficiently, but there are some occasions where overlearning can be appropriate. If there is an area you tend to choke in, overlearning can help create automaticity. Practicing in different environments can also help prevent choking.    
  Like mentioned before, just rereading text and notes is not the most efficient way to learn. What’s even worse is that it can give the feeling of accomplishment that you are learning when you are not. This is called the Illusion of Competence. Focusing on easy problems instead of the more difficult ones also contributes to this. Continually doing this can result in Einstellung. This German word meaning ‘mindset’ is a pattern that has become a habit but is actually preventing you from learning or growing. Sticking to the same studying routine even if you’re not performing well would be an example of this. 
And of course, don’t forget your breaks! 

# How to mitigate Procrastination
  Finally, to the section I waited last to write. :P Procrastination has always been my biggest pain point. I have never seen a more interesting and detailed explanation into what procrastination is until the course. I think it truly helps to understand the underlying root of procrastination before tackling it.  
  
Unhappy feeling -> 2. Attention to a more pleasant task -> 3. Feel happy (temporarily)

Procrastination shares features with addiction. It involves making irrational excuses that sound reasonable. 

**Habits**
Chunking is related to habits. And Habits are an energy saver. It allows you to free up the mind for other activities. Habits are powerful because they create neurological cravings. Procrastination is automatic! You often aren’t aware you are procrastinating until well into your web surfing binge. 

4 Parts to a Habit
The cue - the trigger to start a habit
The routine - “zombie mode” response to the cue
The reward - feeling of pleasure
The belief - habits have power b/c you believe in them

The cues can be a variety of things from a location, time, feelings/mood, or reaction. Routine is where the change needs to take place. Have a plan on how to combat procrastination ahead of time! The reward can be a bit more difficult. Why are you procrastinating? Can you substitute this emotional payoff with a reward instead? Only when the brain expects a reward will habits start rewiring. Finally, the belief. Believing in your new plan will help with your success. You can also find support from others. 

**Feelings**
Because procrastination is caused by negative feelings, it’s imperative to be able to put those feelings aside. In order to do that, focus on the process and not the product. It’s the feelings toward the product (the task, assignment, etc) that triggers the procrastination. The brain likes processes because they can be automated. So instead of focusing on the assignment and its deadline, focus on sitting for 30 minutes and work on a task. Avoiding and learning to deal with distractions is also important. 

**The Plan**
  So now that you know more than you ever expected to procrastinate, what’s the next step? Well now you that you know what your new routines and rewards will be, it’s time to start building new habits and be productive. I simple time management technique is the Pomodoro method. Ths breaks your time into twelve 25 minute chunks with breaks of varying length between. It’s easy to find pomodoro timers online or just use a browser timer. If you haven’t noticed, this allows for focused learning and diffused time to relax between. Weekly and daily planning lists are important as well. The night before review the following day, this will help with diffuse learning. The weekly planning will allow you to review the previous week and see if any changes need to be made to get tasks done. Set planned down time as well!
  Willpower is a finite resource and takes energy. You shouldn’t use it to fight procrastination unless absolutely necessary. We don’t want to completely change habits, just override part of old ones and develop a few new ones. Try and do your hardest tasks first in the day. Otherwise completing small easy tasks can once again create an illusion of competence where you’re not accomplishing as much you think.
